# TODO
## Add a "reason" argument to the sfk command

e.g. 

!afk in a meeting

Then the bot can supply some context when another user tries to talk to the afk
person.

## Add !wiki and !search commands

!wiki to fetch top wiki result (first paragraph of wikipedia page?)
!search to return first search result
