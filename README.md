# ircbot

Simple IRC bot in python.

Responds to a few commands.

 - !fortune  to run fortune on server and display the result
 - !hi       to greet the bot like a polite person
 - !afk      to register as going AFK, bot will save messages and send once 
             you return.
 - and others

Future plans, to have the bot check the running status of programs on the sim
server, check things like weather forecast or perhaps calendar/todo stuff.. maybe 
work in multiple channels?
